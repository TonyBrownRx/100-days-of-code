## Log

### R1D1 
Established a GitHub, Medium, and Twitter account. Spent at least 1 hour on @freeCodeCamp's Basic CSS coding challenges. Already completed Basic HTML and HTML5.

### R1D2
Spent time today trying to understand Github & Codepen. I tried to the FCC Tribute Page project but opted for a more simple project. I made a simple To-Do List just get used to using Github. Link to commit: https://github.com/TonyBrownRx/To-Do-List/commits/master
