# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Tony Brown]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 10, Saturday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Established a GitHub, Medium, and Twitter account. Spent at least 1 hour on @freeCodeCamp's Basic CSS coding challenges. Already completed Basic HTML and HTML5.

### R1D2
Spent time today trying to understand Github & Codepen. I tried to the FCC Tribute Page project but opted for a more simple project. I made a simple To-Do List just get used to using Github. Link to commit: https://github.com/TonyBrownRx/To-Do-List/commits/master


### R1D3
Added a CSS file to my To-Do List project. Was able to link CSS to HTML file. Used terminal & effectively used git commands (e.g., add, commit, push, & pull). Link to commit: https://github.com/TonyBrownRx/To-Do-List/commits/master

### R1D4
Played around with creating borders on To-Do list project. Added a button, textarea, & form. Added extensions to VS code to make coding easier. 

### R1D5
Worked on FFC curriculum all day. Finished CSS and about half of Applied Visual Design.

### R1D6
Worked on FFC curriculum all day to continue building a foundation.

### R1D7
Made it to the 1st project section of FCC. Started working on my 1st real project. Link to project: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

### R1D8
Finished 1st FCC project (Tribute Page). Link to project: https://codepen.io/TonyBrownRx/pen/xxKOORb

### R1D9
Figured out how to work on projects in VS code rather than CodePen. Reviewed my code from last project to see how I could have done better. Will start 2nd project tomorrow.

### R1D10
Started working on 2nd FCC project (Survey Form). After hitting road blocks I decided to read Learning Web Design by Jennifer Robbins to build a better foundation & make projects go smoother.
